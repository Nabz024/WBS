# AI EMAIL AUTOMATION INITIATIVE
## Merged Artefact Pack - Governance Review Version

---

# 1️⃣ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## What Changed

**Integration Approach**: Pack A provided highly detailed technical specifications for the AOP↔BOR interface that were absent in Pack B. These have been integrated as implementation-level requirements within Pack B's broader requirements framework.

**Governance Maturity**: Pack B's comprehensive governance structure (RACI, ADRs, testing strategy, rollout plan) has been retained as the primary framework, with Pack A's technical controls embedded within it.

**Compliance Depth**: Pack A's GDPR Article 22 implementation details and specific PII handling mechanisms have been merged into Pack B's compliance framework, elevating the technical specificity of guardrails.

**Risk Granularity**: RAID entries from both packs have been consolidated, preserving unique risks while merging overlapping concerns. Pack A's more technical risks complement Pack B's strategic risks.

## What Was Kept

**From Pack B (Baseline Structure)**:
- Overall document organization (Requirements, Guardrails, RAID, PM Artifacts)
- Executive-friendly narrative format
- RACI matrix and organizational accountability
- Architecture decision records framework
- Phased rollout strategy (Phases 1-4)
- Broader regulatory compliance coverage (beyond GDPR)
- Success metrics and KPI framework

**From Pack A (Technical Depth)**:
- Specific functional requirements for AOP-BOR interface (FR-INT-001 through FR-INT-005)
- Detailed guardrail implementations (GR-PII-001, GR-HAL-001, GR-HIT-001, GR-SEC-001)
- Precise technical thresholds and validation logic
- Multi-layer hallucination detection approach
- Prompt injection defense mechanisms
- AI Team strategic enablers (SDK, sandbox, automated guardrail injection)

## What Was Discarded

**From Pack A**:
- Standalone structure - integrated into Pack B's framework instead
- Some duplicate RAID entries (merged into Pack B's more descriptive format)

**From Pack B**:
- Generic compliance language where Pack A provided superior technical specificity
- Some higher-level requirements now superseded by Pack A's detailed interface specs

## Unresolved Decisions Requiring Steering Committee Input

| Decision ID | Decision Required | Options | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------------|------------------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **DEC-001** | **AOP Authorship Model** | A: Business users write AOPs directly with AI Team providing SDK/sandbox (Pack A model)<br>B: AI Team develops AOPs with business user input (Pack B model) | Affects resource planning, training investment, time-to-value | **Recommend hybrid**: Start with AI Team authorship (Phase 1-2), transition to business user authorship with SDK (Phase 3-4) |
| **DEC-002** | **BOR Query SLA Targets** | A: Sub-100ms p95 latency (Pack A)<br>B: General "performant" language (Pack B) | Affects infrastructure investment, BOR team commitments | **Recommend**: Adopt Pack A's 100ms target with graduated SLA by phase |
| **DEC-003** | **Human Review Financial Threshold** | A: €10,000 (Pack A)<br>B: Unspecified (Pack B) | Affects operational load, risk exposure | **Recommend**: €10,000 for Phases 1-2, review for adjustment in Phase 3 based on data |
| **DEC-004** | **GDPR Article 22 Scope** | A: All automated decisions (Pack A strict interpretation)<br>B: Subset of high-impact decisions (Pack B pragmatic) | Affects development complexity, legal risk | **Recommend**: Legal team to define "legal/significant effect" criteria; implement Pack A's explanation framework for that subset |

## SECTION 3: REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Functional Requirements - Core Capabilities

#### 3.1.1 Agent Framework Capabilities (from Pack B)

**REQ-001: Natural Language Understanding**
- Extract intent, entities, and context from incoming emails
- Handle multi-turn conversation threads with context preservation
- Support multiple languages where business domains require

**REQ-002: Response Generation**
- Leverage large language models with RAG pattern (per ADR-002)
- Template management and output formatting controls
- Tone and style consistency across domains

**REQ-003: Multi-Step Reasoning**
- Execute conditional logic defined in AOPs
- Orchestrate multiple BOR queries and information synthesis
- Support human-in-the-loop checkpoints

### 3.1.2 AOP-BOR Interface Requirements (from Pack A - Enhanced Specificity)

**FR-INT-001: Data Contract & Schema Governance** [CRITICAL]

The AOP must interface with BOR through strictly versioned data contracts:

- **Schema Specification**: All BOR queries use OpenAPI 3.0+ with field-level PII tags (`pii: true/false`, `sensitivity: critical/high/medium`)
- **Declaration Model**: AOPs declare required BOR fields in manifest; runtime access to undeclared fields triggers automatic denial
- **Drift Detection**: BOR schema changes trigger affected AOPs into "degraded mode" (mandatory human review) until re-validation completes
- **AI Team Responsibility**: Maintain data contract registry, version management, backward compatibility testing
- **Business User View**: Declare *what* data needed, platform handles *how* to retrieve safely

**FR-INT-002: Contextual Grounding API** [CRITICAL]

All AOP-generated content involving financial data must be grounded in BOR with full traceability:

- **Source Attribution**: Every factual claim includes metadata: `{bor_record_id, field_path, timestamp, confidence_score}`
- **Grounding Validation**: 
  - Data exists in BOR
  - Value matches within tolerance (configurable per field type)
  - Timestamp within staleness window (5min for balances, 24hr for KYC data)
- **Failure Handling**: Failed grounding checks → "fact-check required" status → human reviewer queue
- **Implementation**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern (ADR-002) with citation linking

**FR-INT-003: Asynchronous BOR Query Handling** [HIGH]

AOPs must handle BOR latency gracefully:

- **Timeout Management**: BOR queries timeout at 2s (configurable per AOP); fallback to cached data with explicit disclaimer: "Data as of [timestamp]"
- **Circuit Breaker**: After 3 consecutive timeouts → AOP "safe mode" using pre-approved templates only
- **Backpressure**: If BOR p95 latency >100ms → workflow platform pauses new AOP activations
- **AI Team Responsibility**: Abstract async complexity from business users

**FR-INT-004: Transactional Integrity** [CRITICAL]

AOPs triggering BOR updates must maintain ACID properties:

- **Two-Phase Commit**: Email dispatch ↔ BOR status update must be atomic
- **Rollback**: Email sent + BOR update failed → automatic rollback with ops team alert
- **Idempotency**: All BOR write operations require idempotency keys preventing duplicate processing

**FR-INT-005: Multi-Domain Data Isolation** [HIGH]

AOPs must respect domain boundaries:

- **Access Control**: BOR enforces field-level permissions; AOP runtime JWT includes `domain_scope` claim
- **Cross-Domain Requests**: Require explicit allowlist entry + secondary approval
- **Query Filtering**: Results filtered by domain; unauthorized access attempts → security event log
- **Domains**: Retail Banking, Wealth Management, Commercial Lending (extensible)

### 3.1.3 AOP Framework Requirements

**REQ-010: Protocol Development Interface**
- Declarative DSL or low-code interface for business users (target state)
- Version control integration with approval workflows
- Testing sandbox with mock BOR (AI Team strategic enabler)
- Compliance linter validating against guardrails pre-deployment

**REQ-011: Protocol Validation & Testing**
- Automated regression testing against compliance test suite
- "Sandbox execution mode" for new protocol versions
- Performance profiling (query count, latency, resource usage)
- Bias testing across demographic groups

**REQ-012: Protocol Governance**
- Immutable versioning with blue/green deployment
- Review/approval workflow before production
- Performance monitoring per protocol (accuracy, escalation rate, error rate)
- Rollback capability

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-001: Performance** (from Pack B with Pack A enhancements)
- System availability: 99.9% during business hours
- Processing latency: <5s p95 for automated responses
- BOR query latency: <100ms p95 for standard lookups (Pack A target)
- Throughput: 1,000 emails/hour/instance with linear horizontal scaling

**NFR-002: Security**
- Defense-in-depth architecture
- Mutual TLS for all API communications
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Least-privilege access with JWT-based authorization
- Prompt injection defenses (GR-SEC-001)

**NFR-003: Reliability**
- Fault tolerance with circuit breakers
- Automated failover (RTO <15min, RPO <15min)
- Graceful degradation to templated responses
- Chaos engineering validation

**NFR-004: Scalability**
- Microservices architecture (ADR-003)
- Stateless services enabling horizontal scaling
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth and latency metrics
- Multi-region deployment capability

## SECTION 4: GUARDRAILS & COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Data Privacy & PII Controls

#### GR-PII-001: Dynamic Data Masking [CRITICAL]

**Implementation** (from Pack A):

BOR interface layer applies automatic masking based on AOP context and recipient verification:

| Data Type | Masking Rule | Reveal Condition |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| SSN | Show last 4 only | Recipient verified via SMS OTP <15min ago |
| Account Numbers | Show last 4 only | Recipient verified via SMS OTP <15min ago |
| IBAN | Show last 4 only | Recipient verified via SMS OTP <15min ago |
| Email Addresses | Show first 2 chars + domain | Conditional based on context |
| Phone Numbers | Show last 4 digits | Conditional based on context |

**Audit Trail**: All unmasking events logged with:
- `requestor_aop_id`
- `justification_context`
- `approver_id` (if manual override)
- Timestamp and recipient verification method

**Regulatory Alignment**: GDPR Article 5(1)(c) data minimization, Article 5(1)(b) purpose limitation

**AI Team Responsibility**: Maintain masking rule engine; business users declare data needs, masking applied automatically

#### GR-PII-002: GDPR Article 22 - Right to Explanation [CRITICAL]

**Scope**: Any email constituting "automated decision-making with legal or significant effect"

**Implementation**:
- AOP manifest flag: `article22_applicable: true/false`
- Platform auto-generates explanation payload stored in BOR: `{decision_logic, key_factors, alternative_outcomes}`
- Email footer auto-injected: *"This decision was automated. You have the right to request human review, explanation, or contest this decision. [Request Review]"*
- Human review requests → SLA-bound ticket (24h response) + pause automated follow-ups

**AI Team Responsibility**: Explanation scaffolding generation; business users mark applicability in manifest

**DECISION REQUIRED** (DEC-004): Legal team to define precise criteria for "legal/significant effect" in banking context

### 4.2 Accuracy & Hallucination Prevention

#### GR-HAL-001: Multi-Layer Financial Data Validation [CRITICAL]

**Implementation** (from Pack A with Pack B integration):

Four-layer validation pipeline before email dispatch:

| Layer | Validation Type | Check | Action on Failure |
|-------|----------------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Structural** | Regex for currency formats, date ranges, account checksums | Reject generation, alert AOP owner |
| 2 | **Semantic** | Cross-reference numeric claims vs. BOR using symbolic math engine | Flag for human review |
| 3 | **Consistency** | Temporal logic (e.g., due date > today) | Auto-correct with BOR or escalate |
| 4 | **Cross-Reference** | Aggregate claims match individual BOR records | Reject generation |

**Threshold**: 
- 2+ layer failures → automatic block
- 1 failure → warning + human review queue

**Measurement**: Track layer-specific failure rates; tune thresholds quarterly based on false positive analysis

#### GR-HAL-002: Confidence Scoring & Uncertainty Quantification [CRITICAL]

**Implementation**:
- Every AOP output includes `confidence_score` (0.0-1.0) derived from:
  - Grounding source diversity
  - Model entropy
  - Historical accuracy for similar queries
- **Threshold**: Scores <0.85 → "draft mode" (human approval required)
- **Language Enforcement**: Flag uncertain paraphrases ("approximately," "around") for specific financial amounts
- **Learning Loop**: Human reviewer feedback updates confidence calibration

**Integration with FR-INT-002**: Grounding API provides per-claim confidence; aggregate score determines dispatch decision

### 4.3 Human Oversight Controls

#### GR-HIT-001: Human-in-the-Loop Mandatory Triggers [CRITICAL]

**Automatic Escalation Conditions** (from Pack A):

| Trigger Type | Condition | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Financial Impact** | Amount >€10,000 (configurable per domain) | Risk mitigation for high-value decisions |
| **Regulatory Keywords** | Detection of: "complaint," "ombudsman," "lawyer," "regulator," "fraud" | Reputational/legal risk |
| **Sentiment Risk** | Customer input sentiment <-0.7 (highly negative) | Customer satisfaction protection |
| **Novelty Detection** | Scenario outside training distribution (embedding distance >threshold) | Unknown-unknown handling |
| **Explicit Override** | Customer requests human agent | Respect customer preference |
| **Data Mismatch** | BOR returns conflicting data across queries | Data integrity concern |
| **Low Confidence** | Confidence score <0.85 (GR-HAL-002) | Accuracy protection |

**Workflow**: Trigger detected → Pause dispatch → Route to qualified reviewer pool → Capture feedback for model retraining

**SLA**: Human review completed within 4 hours (business hours) or 24 hours (after hours) for non-urgent; 1 hour for regulatory keyword triggers

### 4.4 Security Controls

#### GR-SEC-001: Prompt Injection Defense [HIGH]

**Defense-in-Depth Approach** (from Pack A):

1. **Input Sanitization**: Customer email parsed through injection classifier before reaching AOP context
2. **Context Isolation**: System prompt and user input separated with delimiters; AOP instructed to ignore delimiter-escaped content
3. **Output Validation**: Generated email scanned for instruction leak patterns ("ignore previous instructions," "system prompt:")
4. **Privilege Fencing**: AOPs operate with least-privilege BOR tokens:
   - Write access restricted to specific tables
   - Row-level security enforced
   - No admin/schema modification permissions

**Testing**: Quarterly red team exercises with adversarial prompting scenarios

**Monitoring**: Log all suspected injection attempts; alert security team on patterns

### 4.5 Compliance Monitoring & Audit

**Audit Trail Requirements**:
- Complete logging of: email receipt, BOR queries, grounding checks, confidence scores, human reviews, final responses
- Tamper-evident logs with cryptographic checksums
- Retention: 7 years (regulatory requirement)
- Real-time compliance dashboard for governance committee

**Bias Monitoring**:
- Quarterly fairness audits across protected demographics
- Statistical testing for disparate outcomes (response quality, escalation rates, processing times)
- Remediation within 30 days of confirmed bias finding

## SECTION 8: AI TEAM STRATEGIC ENABLERS

*(From Pack A - Critical for Business User Empowerment Model)*

To achieve the vision of business users writing AOPs safely without breaking the system, the AI Team must deliver:

### 8.1 AOP SDK & Sandbox

**Objective**: Enable local AOP development and testing without production risk

**Components**:
- **Mock BOR**: Realistic test data covering common scenarios and edge cases
- **Hallucination Detection Preview**: Real-time feedback on grounding quality during authoring
- **Compliance Linter**: Pre-flight checks against guardrails (PII handling, Article 22, bias)
- **Performance Profiler**: Query count, latency, resource usage estimation
- **Test Scenario Generator**: Auto-generate test cases from AOP logic

**Delivery**: Phase 0 (Month 3)

### 8.2 Automated Guardrail Injection

**Objective**: Business users write *what* AOP should do; platform injects *how* to do it safely

**Auto-Injected Controls**:
- PII masking based on declared BOR fields (GR-PII-001)
- Grounding checks for all financial data references (FR-INT-002, GR-HAL-001)
- HITL triggers based on domain configuration (GR-HIT-001)
- Input sanitization and output validation (GR-SEC-001)
- Article 22 explanation scaffolding if flagged in manifest (GR-PII-002)

**Implementation**: Platform middleware intercepts AOP execution, applies guardrails transparently

**Delivery**: Phase 0-1 (Months 3-4)

### 8.3 Observability by Design

**Objective**: Every AOP execution produces structured logs for compliance, performance, and feedback

**Telemetry Captured**:
- AOP identifier and version
- BOR queries executed (with latency and results metadata)
- Grounding checks performed (pass/fail per claim)
- Confidence scores and escalation decisions
- Human review outcomes (approve/modify/reject + feedback)
- Customer interaction (sentiment, satisfaction)

**Use Cases**:
- Compliance auditing (regulatory examination support)
- Model performance tracking (accuracy, drift detection)
- Business user feedback loops (AOP optimization suggestions)
- Incident investigation (root cause analysis)

**Delivery**: Phase 0 (Month 3)

### 8.4 Progressive Exposure

**Objective**: New AOPs earn trust through demonstrated performance

**Automation Graduation Path**:
1. **Phase 1 - Shadow Mode**: 100% human review, AI output visible for comparison
2. **Phase 2 - Assisted Mode**: 50% human review, AI handles low-risk cases
3. **Phase 3 - Monitored Automation**: 10% human review sampling, full automation
4. **Phase 4 - Autonomous**: <1% sampling, exceptional escalations only

**Graduation Criteria** (must sustain 4 weeks):
- Accuracy >90%
- Escalation precision <10% false positives
- Zero compliance violations
- Customer satisfaction maintained

**Rollback Triggers**:
- Accuracy drop >5 percentage points
- Any compliance violation
- Customer satisfaction decline >10%
- Security incident

**Delivery**: Policy framework Phase 0; automated enforcement Phase 1

# 🔹 MISSING ARTEFACTS

The merged pack is comprehensive, but the following would strengthen governance:

1. **Detailed Cost Model**: Neither pack includes TCO analysis or budget breakdown (infrastructure, labor, licensing, operations)
2. **Data Retention Policy**: Compliance requirements for email/logs are mentioned but not detailed (7 years stated, but retention strategy for different data types needed)
3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: RTO/RPO stated but full DR procedures and testing cadence not documented
4. **Third-Party Risk Assessment**: LLM provider, cloud infrastructure, IdP dependencies mentioned but formal TPRM assessment not included
5. **Customer Communication Plan**: How will customers be informed about AI automation? What messaging for opt-out or escalation requests?
6. **Regulatory Engagement Strategy**: Proactive regulator communication mentioned but no formal plan
7. **Model Card Template**: For each deployed LLM, standardized documentation of capabilities, limitations, biases, intended use
8. **Exit Criteria Detail**: Phase gates have success criteria but not detailed exit checklists (e.g., "security approval obtained" needs sub-criteria)

**Recommendation**: Develop these artefacts during Phase 0 detailed planning.
