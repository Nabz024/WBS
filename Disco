Agentic Delivery – How We Plan & Deliver Work

Purpose of This Page

This page explains the concepts and rationale behind how we plan and deliver agentic / LLM-based solutions. It is intentionally framework-agnostic and focuses on why we work this way, not on specific methodologies or tooling.

The aim of this phase is to strengthen discovery and planning, enable meaningful estimation, and reduce end-to-end delivery risk. This approach is iterative by design and will evolve as we learn from delivery.

Core Idea

> End-to-end does not mean fully featured.
End-to-end means minimally viable, observable behaviour across the whole flow.



We prioritise seeing how the system behaves when everything is connected, then iteratively strengthen parts of the system based on evidence.


---

Why This Approach

Agentic and LLM-based systems behave differently from traditional software:

behaviour is probabilistic

failure modes are often silent

issues only surface when components interact


Optimising individual parts in isolation can create false confidence. A thin end-to-end baseline exposes the right risks early and provides a stable reference point for iteration.


---

High-Level Delivery Lifecycle

We follow a familiar delivery lifecycle, adapted for learning-heavy systems:

1. Discovery

Purpose: Establish shared understanding before committing to build.

Discovery focuses on:

clarifying the problem and desired outcomes

describing the full end-to-end flow (input → processing → data → output → decision)

identifying assumptions, risks, and dependencies

agreeing what success looks like at an end-to-end level


Discovery ends with a clear decision that the work is ready to plan.


---

2. Build

Purpose: Create working behaviour and learn how the system actually performs.

Build is intentionally iterative. Input handling, reasoning, validation, and controls evolve together rather than in a linear sequence. Work is always anchored to a running end-to-end flow.


---

3. UAT / Pre-Production

Purpose: Validate behaviour with realistic data and usage patterns.

This phase focuses on:

observing end-to-end behaviour

identifying edge cases and silent failure modes

validating confidence thresholds and human intervention points

deciding what to harden, iterate, or constrain next



---

4. Production

Purpose: Operate safely and improve over time.

Production is not an endpoint. Ongoing monitoring, feedback, and iteration are expected as inputs, usage, and behaviour change.


---

Planning at the Right Level

To plan effectively under uncertainty, we organise work around clear objectives and decisions, not internal mechanics.

Work should be defined and estimated in chunks that:

improve behaviour end-to-end

produce tangible outputs

surface risk and learning

end with a decision about what to do next


Estimates are intentionally high-level and support planning and sequencing, not scope lock-in.

Discovery Sign-off Checklist

Discovery is considered ready for sign-off only when the items below are explicitly addressed and agreed.

Problem & Outcomes

[ ] Problem statement is clear (what pain, for whom, why now)

[ ] Desired outcomes are defined (how success will be measured)


End-to-End Understanding

[ ] End-to-end flow described (input → processing → data → output → decision)

[ ] In-scope vs out-of-scope clearly stated


Assumptions, Risks & Dependencies

[ ] Key assumptions documented

[ ] Known risks and unknowns captured (including silent failure risks)

[ ] Dependencies identified (systems, data access, SMEs, environments)


Behaviour & Control

[ ] Human-in-the-loop expectations defined (when to stop or escalate)

[ ] Decision points identified (what learning triggers a change in approach)


Validation & Readiness

[ ] Data and testing approach agreed (examples, volumes, evaluation method)

[ ] Operational constraints known (security, audit, latency, cost)


Discovery Decision

[ ] Discovery reviewed and agreed as ready to plan

[ ] Open questions explicitly carried forward

High-Level Work Definition & Estimation Checklist

Use this section when proposing work items for planning and estimation.

For each high-level work item, confirm:

[ ] Objective – what this work is intended to achieve

[ ] Scope & assumptions – what is included and excluded

[ ] Deliverables – tangible outputs expected

[ ] Success criteria – how outcome will be judged

[ ] Risks or dependencies addressed

[ ] Rough order-of-magnitude estimate

[ ] Confidence level in the estimate (Low / Medium / High)

[ ] Exit decision – what will be decided when this work completes



---

Minimal End-to-End Baseline (First Milestone)

The first milestone for agentic delivery is a minimal end-to-end baseline running in a pre-production environment.

Characteristics

Narrow use case or request type

Minimal but complete processing path

Realistic failure paths exercised

Full observability in place

Human review enabled by default


Expected Outcomes

End-to-end behaviour is observable

Baseline metrics captured

Known failure modes documented

Clear priorities identified for the next iteration


This milestone exists to learn, not to finalise the solution.


---

Iterative Improvement

Once an end-to-end baseline exists, subsequent work focuses on strengthening specific aspects of behaviour based on what has been observed.

Each iteration:

builds on the same end-to-end flow

improves one area at a time

is validated again end-to-end


Over time, this approach produces systems that are both more capable and more reliable.


---

How to Use This Page

Use this guidance to:

revisit and align on discovery

define and estimate work at a sensible level

agree the first end-to-end milestone

provide a shared rationale for how we deliver agentic systems


This approach is iterative by design. The current focus is on discovery and planning; the way we work will continue to evolve as we learn from delivery.

All set 👍 — you now have a single, complete Confluence-ready page that you can paste or publish as-is.

What this version gives you

✅ No framework names (no CRISP-DM, SAFe, Scrum, etc.)

✅ Clear conceptual rationale for your approach

✅ A simple, familiar Discovery → Build → UAT → Prod lifecycle

✅ Explicit acknowledgement that this rollout is iterative

✅ Concrete checklists that make the expectations actionable

✅ A strong justification for:

revisiting discovery

planning at a higher level

epic-level (order-of-magnitude) estimates

E2E first as the initial milestone



Why this will land well

Engineers won’t feel “process-ed”

Delivery/governance get clarity and planning signals

Stakeholders can see why you’re pausing without feeling momentum is lost

The checklists turn intent into something teams can actually do


How I’d use it in practice

1. Link to this page from the email you already drafted


2. Ask the team to:

work through the Discovery Sign-off Checklist

propose high-level work items + estimates using the second checklist



3. Review responses in a short session and agree:

discovery sign-off

first E2E milestone

next iteration focus




If you want next, I can:

Tailor this for a non-technical leadership version

Help you add page properties + reporting views in Confluence

Or write a short FAQ section to pre-empt common pushback


This is a very solid piece of delivery groundwork — you’ve struck the right balance between agility and control.
