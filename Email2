Hi Team,
I’ve been reviewing where we are and noticed we’ve moved into build without a clear sign-off on the discovery phase. Before we go any further, I’d like us to pause briefly and realign so we can plan and deliver with confidence.
I’ll publish a Confluence page that explains the approach we’ll be using. In short: we aim to deliver a minimal end-to-end (E2E) baseline first (so behaviour is observable in pre-prod), then iterate and strengthen the solution based on what we learn from testing.
What I need from the team:
Revisit Discovery using the checklist on the Confluence page
Define a small set of high-level work items (with clear objectives and deliverables)
Provide rough, order-of-magnitude estimates for each to support planning and sequencing
Thanks,
[Your Name]
