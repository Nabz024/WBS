You’re right — what I gave you is **agent-workflow centric**. If your epics are framed as **capabilities** (which is usually cleaner), the card should describe the capability as a **contract**: inputs, outputs, constraints, and how it’s verified — *without* embedding “agent steps” as the unit of work.

Here’s a **Capability Definition Card** version (still works for agentic systems, but doesn’t force you into “agent = epic”).

---

## Capability Definition Card (Agentic or Traditional)

### 1) Capability summary

* **Capability name:**
* **What this enables (plain English):**
* **Who uses it / who benefits:**
* **Business outcome:**
* **In scope (v1):**
* **Out of scope (v1):**

---

### 2) Capability contract (this is the core)

**Inputs (what it needs)**

* Sources: (email system / DB / internal store)
* Required fields:
* Optional fields:
* Preconditions / assumptions:

**Outputs (what it produces)**

* Output artifact(s): (e.g., `VerifiedCustomerRecord`, `ExtractedEmailText`, `ClassificationLabel`, `DraftResponse`)
* Output schema / format:
* Where it writes to / publishes to:

**Quality of service**

* Latency target:
* Throughput target:
* Availability expectations:
* Idempotency / dedupe expectations:

---

### 3) Rules, policies, and constraints

* **Guardrails / boundaries:** (what it must never do)
* **Abstain / fallback policy:** (when it returns “unknown” or routes to human)
* **Privacy & security constraints:** (PII, retention, audit)
* **Compliance constraints:** (if any)

---

### 4) Interfaces & dependencies

* **Upstream dependencies:** (who provides inputs)
* **Downstream consumers:** (who uses outputs)
* **External systems:** (email platform, 3rd-party DB)
* **Owners / contacts:**

  * Email platform host:
  * DB owner:
  * Security/IAM:
  * MLOps/Platform:

---

### 5) Acceptance criteria (observable)

To say this capability is delivered:

* [ ] Output artifacts match the agreed schema
* [ ] Meets QoS targets (latency/throughput)
* [ ] Handles defined failure modes correctly
* [ ] Logging/audit present
* [ ] Security controls in place
* [ ] Works on agreed scenario set

---

### 6) Evaluation & regression (agentic-friendly but capability-framed)

**Scenario set**

* Happy path scenarios:
* Non-happy path scenarios:
* Out-of-distribution examples:

**Metrics**

* Correctness metric(s): (e.g., match accuracy, extraction F1, label accuracy)
* Abstain rate + false-confidence rate
* Human override rate (pilot)
* Safety / privacy violations: target = 0

**Regression trigger**

* On prompt/model changes, DB schema changes, new email formats

---

### 7) Operational requirements

* **Monitoring:** what dashboards/alerts exist for this capability?
* **Runbook:** what to do when it fails?
* **Change control:** who can change prompts/models/rules and how is it approved?
* **Versioning:** schemas + prompts/models versioned and traceable

---

### 8) RAID (capability-level)

* **Risks:**
* **Assumptions:**
* **Issues:**
* **Dependencies:**

---

### 9) Open questions

| Question | Owner | Needed by | Impact |
| -------- | ----- | --------- | ------ |
|          |       |           |        |

## How to use this with capability-based epics (practically)

Instead of epics like “Agent ingests, extracts, verifies…”, you’d have epics/capabilities like:

* **Email Ingestion Capability** (get messages reliably, dedupe, thread context)
* **Attachment Text Conversion Capability** (PDF/DOCX/image → text with provenance)
* **Entity/ID Resolution Capability** (extract candidate IDs + confidence)
* **3rd-Party Verification Capability** (query + match rules + ambiguity handling)
* **Draft Generation Capability** (draft only, evidence-backed)
* **Audit & Observability Capability** (traceability, replay, compliance)

Each gets one card. The “agent” is then a **composition** of capabilities under an operating procedure — but you aren’t forced to build your backlog around “agent steps”.

---

If you paste one of your existing epics (title + 2–3 lines of description), I’ll rewrite it into a **capability epic** and fill the card end-to-end so your team sees the difference immediately.
