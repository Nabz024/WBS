## 1) One-page checklist (maps 1:1 to the Confluence page)

Copy/paste this as a checklist section (or turn into tasks).

### A. Purpose + scope

* [ ] Problem statement written in 3–5 lines
* [ ] Current status captured (Discovery/Build, build started Y/N)
* [ ] In-scope v1 agreed (bullets)
* [ ] Out-of-scope v1 agreed (bullets)
* [ ] Top assumptions listed (max 5)

### B. End-to-end flow (pre-AOP)

* [ ] Strawman E2E flow captured (7 steps max)
* [ ] Thread policy decision logged (latest vs last N vs full chain) **or** explicitly “TBD”
* [ ] “Abstain vs decide” principle captured (even if thresholds TBD)
* [ ] Degraded-mode principle captured (what happens if email/DB unavailable)

### C. Requirements + guardrails

**Functional**

* [ ] FR list captured (P0/P1)
* [ ] Clear statement on allowed actions (draft/route only, no auto-send)

**Guardrails (global)**

* [ ] HITL policy defined (when required, who approves)
* [ ] Action boundary defined (explicit “must not” list)
* [ ] Abstain policy defined (when to route/ask for info)
* [ ] Evidence policy defined (snippets/DB response required)
* [ ] Privacy policy defined (redaction + retention)
* [ ] Tool-use limits defined (max retries, timeouts, DB calls/email)
* [ ] Prompt-injection handling policy defined

**NFRs**

* [ ] Latency target (p95) defined or “TBD + date”
* [ ] Throughput target defined or “TBD + date”
* [ ] Availability target + degraded mode defined
* [ ] Auditability/logging minimum fields defined
* [ ] Security/IAM approach (least privilege) captured
* [ ] Cost control metric captured (DB calls/email)

### D. Data & integration plan (contracts)

**Email platform**

* [ ] Access method + auth model
* [ ] Mailbox/folder scope
* [ ] Trigger mode (poll/push) + rate limits
* [ ] Attachment policy stated (out of scope v1)
* [ ] Idempotency/dedupe approach
* [ ] Retention + replay approach
* [ ] Open questions table completed (owner + due date)

**DB verification**

* [ ] Auth + environments (prod/UAT/sandbox)
* [ ] Allowed query keys + allowed fields
* [ ] Rate limits + latency expectations
* [ ] Error handling + retries
* [ ] Ambiguity policy (no match / multi match)
* [ ] Open questions table completed (owner + due date)

### E. Milestones / epics

* [ ] Epic list agreed (E1–E7 or equivalent)
* [ ] Dependencies per epic captured
* [ ] Epic exit criteria (DoD) captured
* [ ] Open questions that affect the plan listed

### F. RAID (top 10)

* [ ] Top 10 items max (no sprawling log)
* [ ] Each has owner + mitigation + due date
* [ ] Top 3 risks have explicit next action

### G. Test strategy (agentic-friendly)

* [ ] Test levels defined (deterministic + behavioural)
* [ ] Regression suite definition captured (what it is + when run)
* [ ] Metrics list captured (routing, abstain, safety, DB, latency)
* [ ] Eval set plan captured (source + size + coverage)
* [ ] UAT entry criteria defined
* [ ] UAT exit criteria defined

### H. Decisions + actions

* [ ] Decisions log updated (key scope constraints)
* [ ] Actions list created (next 1–2 weeks) with owners/dates

## 2) 90-minute workshop agenda (fills the page live)

**Attendees (minimum):** Delivery/PM, DS lead, Eng lead, platform host rep (email), DB owner rep (or proxy), security/compliance (optional but useful)
**Pre-read (sent ahead):** epic map, 10 sample emails (sanitised), known constraints, links to email/DB docs if available.

### 0) Setup (before starting)

Have the Confluence page open and share screen. You’re filling it in live.

---

### 1) Frame the session (5 min)

**Goal:** “Realign on end-to-end and lock foundations (contracts + guardrails + test approach) so we can engage platform hosts crisply and continue build safely.”

**Output sections filled:** 1) Purpose and current status

---

### 2) Scope re-confirmation (10 min)

* In scope v1 (bullets)
* Out of scope v1 (explicitly: attachments extraction out)
* Assumptions (max 5)

**Output sections filled:** 1) + 2)

---

### 3) E2E flow walkthrough (15 min)

Use one representative email and walk through the strawman flow:

* ingest → normalise → infer intent → verify → draft/route → HITL → audit
  Capture key “TBD decisions” as you go (thread depth, abstain, degraded mode)

**Output sections filled:** 2) End-to-end flow

---

### 4) Data contracts + integration plan (25 min)

Split time roughly:

* **Email platform contract (12 min)**
* **DB contract (13 min)**

For each:

* Fill the baseline contract bullets
* Then fill the **Open questions** table with owner + due date (this is the real value)

**Output sections filled:** 4) Data & integration plan

---

### 5) Guardrails + NFRs (20 min)

**Guardrails (12 min):** agree global policies (HITL, action boundary, abstain rule, evidence, privacy, tool limits, injection handling)
**NFRs (8 min):** pick targets or explicitly mark TBD with owner/date

**Output sections filled:** 3) Requirements & guardrails (incl. NFRs)

---

### 6) Test strategy (10 min)

Lock the minimum viable test approach:

* deterministic tests (integration + logging)
* behavioural eval + regression suite definition
* initial metrics list
* eval set plan (v0.1 size and coverage)
* UAT entry/exit criteria (high level)

**Output sections filled:** 7) Test strategy

---

### 7) RAID top 10 + owners (5 min)

Rapid-fire: only capture the big ones.
Assign owner + next action + due date.

**Output sections filled:** 6) RAID

---

### 8) Milestones / epics sanity check (5 min)

Confirm epics are still the right buckets and add exit criteria if missing.

**Output sections filled:** 5) Milestones / epics

---

### 9) Close: decisions + actions (5 min)

* Update decisions log (scope + HITL + attachment out)
* Create the next 1–2 weeks actions with owners/dates

**Output sections filled:** 8) + 9)

---

## Optional: a tight invite description (copy/paste)

**Title:** E2E Realignment + Integration Readiness (Pre-AOP Foundations)
**Objective:** Align on system boundaries, guardrails, data contracts, test strategy, and top RAID items to unblock platform host conversations and proceed with build safely.
**Pre-read:** epic map + 10 sample emails (sanitised) + current assumptions list.
**Output:** updated Confluence “Foundations” page with owners/dates for all open questions.

If you want, tell me your epic names (or paste your current epic list) and I’ll pre-fill the **Milestones / epics** table with sensible exit criteria tailored to your wording.
