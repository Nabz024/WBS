The repositioned session: “E2E Alignment + Integration Readiness”

Purpose: align on the actual workflow, reduce ambiguity inside epics, and leave with a concrete question-pack + decisions for the email platform hosts + DB owners.

Tone / framing (use this verbatim if you want):

“We did strong early discovery and mapped epics. Now that build has started, we’ve learned where the unknowns really are. This session is to realign on the end-to-end flow, turn epic labels into implementable work, and prepare for crisp conversations with the email platform hosts and the database team.”

What “sign-off” means now: not “everything is known”, but:

the flow is agreed,

the open questions are explicit + owned,

the integration contract questions are ready,

the guardrails + evaluation approach are agreed.

Updated workshop (2h 15m) — timeboxed
1) Context reset + what changed since epic mapping (10 min)

Inputs: original epic map + what you’ve learned from build.
Exercise: “What we thought / what we now know” (3 bullets each).
Output: shared acknowledgement + the right “why now”.

2) E2E walkthrough with a concrete example email (25 min)

This is the missing piece for teams who “don’t see the whole”.

Exercise: run one realistic email through the entire journey:

email arrives → ingestion trigger

classification

extraction (ID + key fields + attachment handling)

verification via DB

reconciliation (what if mismatch?)

draft response / routing decision

HITL

audit trail

Facilitation trick: keep asking “what happens next, exactly?” and “what artifact is produced here?”

Output: one agreed “happy path” and a list of failure paths.

3) Epic de-ambiguation clinic (35 min)

You keep the epic structure, but convert it into implementable definitions.

Method: pick the top 3–5 epics causing confusion (e.g., attachment extraction). For each, fill a one-page “Epic Definition Card” live.

Epic Definition Card (fill in the room)

Epic intent: what outcome exists when done?

Inputs/outputs: what comes in, what leaves (data objects)

Definition of done: observable + testable

Key decisions: thresholds, rules, policies

Dependencies: platform hosts / DB / security / MLOps

Open questions: phrased as questions for external teams

Risks: what breaks, what’s costly

Evaluation: how we know it works (metrics + sample set)

Output: 3–5 Epic Definition Cards + an “unknowns backlog”.

5) Integration readiness: prep the question-pack for platform hosts (25 min)

This is where you “help us with discussions with email platform hosts”.

Split into two mini-breakouts (or do as a single group):

A) Email platform host questions

auth model, service accounts, permissions, shared mailboxes

push vs poll, rate limits, throttling

threading semantics, dedupe strategy

attachment retrieval limits

retention + audit constraints

test mailbox / sandbox availability

B) DB verification questions

lookup keys, match logic, ambiguity rules

rate limits, latency, caching rules

fields allowed + PII constraints

error codes / downtime behaviour

test environment + mock data

Output: a single “Integration Questions Pack” you can paste into Confluence and send.

6) Guardrails + evaluation gate (15 min)

Now that you’ve seen the real flow and the epic definitions, you can lock guardrails realistically.

Minimum to agree today:

action boundaries (draft only, no auto-send; HITL required)

abstain rules (when to say “I don’t know”)

privacy (redaction + retention)

evaluation plan (golden set, baseline metrics, regression cadence)

Output: guardrails v1 + evaluation gate for moving from build → pilot.

7) RAID refresh + owners (10 min)

Short, sharp, owner-driven.

Top 5 risks + mitigations

Top 5 dependencies + dates

Blockers/issues already known

Output: RAID updated with owners + next check-in date.

8) DS feasibility sign-off for the re-aligned plan (5 min)

Not “the whole system”, but:

the defined epics are implementable,

the evaluation is credible,

the integration question-pack is correct,

and the unknowns are surfaced and owned.

Output: sign-off statement + list of blocking open questions.

What to change operationally (so this doesn’t happen again)
Add a “Definition Clinic” gate before build continues on any epic

For agent work especially, “epic mapped” ≠ “epic buildable”.

New rule: an epic cannot enter build unless it has:

clear input/output artifacts,

DoD,

failure modes,

evaluation approach,

external dependencies identified.

Add “E2E demo of thought” every week (15 min)

Not a UI demo — a narrated walkthrough:

“Here’s an example email → here’s what the system did → here’s where confidence was low → here’s the evidence we stored.”

This is how you build shared understanding fast.
A short opener you can use (non-blamey)

“Since we started build, we’ve uncovered where our assumptions were a bit optimistic — especially around attachments, extraction, and what ‘verification’ really means in practice. Today is about turning our epic map into an executable plan, aligning the team on the end-to-end flow, and leaving with a crisp set of questions and decisions ready for the email platform hosts and database owners.”
