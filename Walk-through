Perfect — that constraint actually makes this cleaner and more effective.

Given:

Agentic solution

Primary input = email

One external system queried

Team is ready to build, but you want to sharpen how they think


What you want is a guided walkthrough of the agent lifecycle, with the right questions embedded at each step, so the team internalises a repeatable structure they’ll reuse on every agent going forward.

Below is a very practical session design, tuned exactly to your scenario.


---

🎯 Objective of this Session

Not to design the solution.

But to ensure everyone understands:

How the agent actually behaves end-to-end

Where uncertainty, risk, and decisions live

What questions must be answered before build vs during build



---

🧭 The Core Mental Model (set this up first)

Start the session by drawing this on a board:

Email arrives
   ↓
Ingest & normalise
   ↓
Intent & context extraction
   ↓
Decision: can I act?
   ↓
External system query
   ↓
Compose response
   ↓
Human-in-the-loop (if needed)
   ↓
Send / log / learn

Tell the team:

> “We’re going to walk this once, slowly, and at each step ask
‘what must be true for this to be safe, useful, and shippable?’”




---

⏱️ Suggested Timing (75–90 mins)

Framing: 5–10 mins

Agent walkthrough (step-by-step): 45 mins

Cross-cutting questions: 15 mins

Close & actions: 10 mins



---

🧠 Step-by-Step Walkthrough (This is the session)

1️⃣ Email Ingest & Normalisation

Ask the team:

What counts as an email we should process?

What are we explicitly not handling?

How do we identify the request boundary (thread, chain, attachments)?

What metadata matters (sender, domain, timestamp, thread ID)?


Key delivery question:

> “What breaks if this assumption is wrong?”



🚩 Common hidden risk:

Assuming emails are clean, single-intent, or well-formed



---

2️⃣ Intent & Context Extraction

This is where agentic systems usually silently fail.

Ask:

What intent labels exist today?

What happens if an email fits none or multiple intents?

How confident does the model need to be before acting?

What contextual signals are mandatory vs nice-to-have?


Force a concrete answer to:

> “What does low confidence mean in code?”




---

3️⃣ Decision Point: Can the Agent Act?

Pause here deliberately.

Ask:

What conditions allow fully automated handling?

What conditions force human review?

Is “do nothing” a valid outcome?


This is the control point of the system.

Write this explicitly:

IF confidence ≥ X
AND required fields present
AND external system reachable
THEN proceed
ELSE escalate

If they can’t articulate this → you’ve found a real gap.


---

4️⃣ External System Query (Only One — Good)

Zoom in hard here.

Ask:

What exactly are we asking the external system?

What is the unique identifier and where does it come from?

What are the failure modes (timeout, partial data, stale data)?

Are we allowed to cache results?


Critical delivery question:

> “What happens to the user if this system is down?”



This is where dependencies become delivery risks, not abstract concepts.


---

5️⃣ Response Composition

Ask:

Is the response deterministic or variable?

What constraints exist (tone, compliance, wording)?

Can the agent explain why it answered this way?

Do we need structured outputs or free text?


Good forcing question:

> “Could a human read this and understand the decision path?”




---

6️⃣ Human-in-the-Loop

Be very explicit here.

Ask:

When does a human step in?

What information do they see?

Can they correct the agent?

Do corrections feed back into learning or rules?


This separates:

Assistive automation

from delegated decision-making



---

7️⃣ Logging, Audit, and Learning

End the walkthrough with operations.

Ask:

What do we log per email?

What lets us answer “why did this happen?”

What metrics define success in week 1 vs month 3?

How do we detect silent failure?


If observability is vague → prod readiness isn’t there yet.


---

🔁 Cross-Cutting Questions (Last 15 mins)

Now zoom out and ask the whole room:

What assumption makes you most nervous?

What would you want alerted at 3am?

What would you not automate yet?


Capture answers as:

Assumptions

Risks

Pre-build questions


These go straight into RAID.


---

📌 How You Close the Session

End with something like:

> “We’re green to build once these specific questions are answered.
Anything else we’ll learn during build — but these are non-negotiable.”



Then clearly mark:

✅ Questions to answer before coding

🟡 Questions acceptable to resolve during iteration



---

🧩 Why This Works for Your Case

Keeps focus on behaviour, not architecture

Makes the single external dependency explicit and manageable

Teaches the team a reusable agent walkthrough pattern

Prevents “it worked in tests” surprises



---

If you want next, I can:

Turn this into a 1-page facilitation script

Convert the steps into a Confluence page template

Map this directly to UAT readiness vs Prod readiness

Create a checklist engineers must complete before merging


Just tell me which artefact you want.
